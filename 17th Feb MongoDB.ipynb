    "MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular, open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for a more dynamic and scalable approach to handling data compared to traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases: Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexible schema design. Unlike SQL databases, they do not require predefined schemas and can store data in various formats, including documents, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, and graph databases.\n",

    "Flexible Schema Design: When the data model needs frequent changes or is not well-defined in advance.\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: When the application requires scaling out by distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
