    "\n",
    "Modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Open file for reading. (default)\n",
    "'w': Open file for writing. Creates a new file or truncates existing file.\n",
    "'a': Open file for appending. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "'b': Binary mode.\n",
    "'t': Text mode. (default)\n",
    "'+': Open a file for updating (reading and writing).\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Opens the file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "'w': Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it is truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "'a': Opens the file for appending. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "'b': Opens the file in binary mode. This mode is used for non-text files, such as images or executables.\n",
    "'t': Opens the file in text mode. (default) This mode is used for text files.\n",
    "'+': Opens the file for both reading and writing."
