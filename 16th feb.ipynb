    "Database: A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, storage, and manipulation of data. It provides mechanisms for defining, querying, updating, and managing data.\n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases: SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables and use SQL as the standard language for managing and manipulating the data. They have a predefined schema, enforce strict data consistency, and support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases: NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide flexible schemas and are designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are horizontally scalable and offer high performance and availability. NoSQL databases use different data models such as document-oriented, key-value, columnar, and graph databases. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis."
