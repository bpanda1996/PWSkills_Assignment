    "An exception in Python is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It occurs when an error or unexpected condition is encountered during runtime, leading to the termination of the program if not handled properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are categorized based on their cause and can include errors such as division by zero (`ZeroDivisionError`), trying to access an index that is out of range (`IndexError`), or attempting to open a file that does not exist (`FileNotFoundError`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "- Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur during the parsing stage before the execution begins.\n",
    "- Exceptions are runtime errors that disrupt the program's execution, while syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter when it encounters invalid syntax in the code.\n",
    "- Exceptions are caused by factors such as invalid user input, unexpected conditions, or errors in the program's logic, while syntax errors are caused by violations of the language's grammar rules.\n",
    "- Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks to prevent the program from crashing, while syntax errors must be corrected in the code before the program can be executed successfully."
