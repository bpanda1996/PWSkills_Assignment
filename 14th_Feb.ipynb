    "Ans to 1. Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread represents a separate flow of execution within the same process. Multithreading is used to improve the performance of programs by utilizing the available CPU resources more efficiently, especially for I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks. The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading."

    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they need. A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data and attempt to change it at the same time, leading to unpredictable results. Both deadlocks and race conditions are common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs and must be carefully managed to ensure proper synchronization and thread safety."
