    "Ans to Q1. Abstraction in OOPs refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. \n",
    "It allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, consider a Car class. From the perspective of a user, \n",
    "they only need to know how to drive the car, i.e., they interact with the car's methods like start(), stop(), accelerate(), etc., \n",

    "Ans to Q2. Abstraction and Encapsulation are two different concepts in OOPs but often confused with each other. \n",
    "Abstraction: It focuses on the outside view of an object, hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary features.  For example, a Car class may provide methods like start() and stop() without revealing how these methods are implemented internally. \n",
    "Encapsulation: It involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components. It protects the internal state of an object from being directly accessed from outside the class. \n",
    "For example, in a Car class, you may encapsulate the speed attribute and provide getter and setter methods to access and modify it, respectively.\n",

    "Ans to Q3. The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides tools for creating abstract base classes. \n",
